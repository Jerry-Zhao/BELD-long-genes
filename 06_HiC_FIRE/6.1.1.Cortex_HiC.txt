 ##Restriction Sites
  One major problem that can arise during Hi-C is that "background" ligation events may occur.  These are ligation events that occur after sonication [I think] 
  as they seem to occur between random fragments of DNA with no regard to restriction site used for the Hi-C assay.  In theory, all reads should be in the vicinity 
  of the restriction site used for the assay, and if they aren't, there is a good chance they are noise (more later on this).  To see the distribution of reads around 
  your restriction site, use the option "-restrictionSite <seq>" (i.e. "-restrictionSite AAGCTT").  You MUST specify the genome so that HOMER can figure out where the 
  restriction sites are located (i.e. "-genome mm9").  If the restriction site has a lot of star activity, you can also add "-rsmis <#>" (i.e. "-rsmis 1") to indicate 
  how many mismatches are tolerated in the sites.  By default it only looks for perfect restriction sites.

 ##Filtering Uninformative Reads
  The Hi-C protocol can produce sequencing libraries that contain many read pairs that are not representative of true interactions.  This includes continuous genomic 
  fragments, self-ligation or re-ligation products, and background non-specific ligation that occurs independent of a restriction site.

   The background model creation process can be broken down into the following steps (example uses resolution of 100kb):
   1. Divide the genome into putative regions (i.e. chr1:0-10kb, chr1:10kb-20kb, ... chrY:890kb-900kb)
   2. Calculate the total read coverage in each region
   3. Calculate the fraction of interactions spanning any given distance with respect to read depth
   4. Optimize read count model to correctly assign expected interaction counts in regions with uneven sequencing depth
   5. Calculate variation in interaction frequencies as a function of distance.

 3.3 Finding Significant Interactions in Hi-C Data
  3.3.1 Finding Significant Interactions from whole genome (might be slow)
  %%%%% analyzeHiC RenLab_HiC_cortex_merge_filtered -res 10000 -superRes 10000 -maxDist 3000000 -interactions RenLab_HiC_cortex_sigInter_genome_10k10k.txt -nomatrix -cpu 12
  %%%%% analyzeHiC RenLab_HiC_cortex_merge_filtered -res 2000  -superRes 10000 -maxDist 3000000 -interactions RenLab_HiC_cortex_sigInter_genome_2k10k.txt -nomatrix -cpu 12
  %%%%% analyzeHiC RenLab_HiC_cortex_merge_filtered -res 2000  -superRes 2000  -maxDist 3000000 -interactions RenLab_HiC_cortex_sigInter_genome_2k2k.txt -nomatrix -cpu 12

 ##This command will search for significant interactions in the genome at 1Mb resolution. The "-nomatrix" is optional, 
   but since the default of analyzeHiC is to produce a matrix, you may want (or need) to stop creation of the matrix as it could be very large and consume too much memory.

 ## Limiting the Search Space
    The further apart regions get, the less reads that are likely to map between them, and the less likely that a significant interaction is to be found.  Depending on 
    the resolution and the sequencing depth, it can be next to impossible to identify "significant interactions" past a certain distance.   To control the space that is 
    searched, specify "-maxDist <#>" or "-minDist <#>".  This can dramatically speed up the search for high resolution interactions (i.e. "-res 10000 -maxDist 3000000").

  # The premise behind finding significant interactions is simple enough: Look for pairs of regions that have more Hi-C reads between them than would be expected by chance. 
    The expected number of reads is calculated using the background model (covered here).  The background model is used to model how many reads we expect to connect to 
    each other region in the genome.  If regions are far away (or on separate chromosomes), the we expect only a small number of reads to connect them.  Likewise, if two 
    regions are close to one another, we would expect a large number of interactions.  These expectations are also dependent on the number of total reads mapping to each 
    locus (which may depend on the number of restriction sites etc. in the region).  The background model attempts to take all of these factors into account.

    Since the total number of reads per region is fixed (and more or less constant for each region due to the unbiased nature of Hi-C), we test how these reads are 
    distributed relative to the expectation.  For two given loci that could potentially interact, we model their randomly expected read counts using the cumulative 
    binomial distribution, where the total number of trials is the number of reads that could possibly map between the loci (i.e. the region total), the rate of success 
    is the expected interaction frequency, and the number of observed successes is the number of observed reads mapping between the loci.  In this setting, regions with 
    only 1 or 2 reads between them will have high p-values, regardless of their expected interaction frequency, while regions with many interactions above expected will 
    have low p-values. 

  # The interaction file can be further analyzed with commands in the sections below, or it can be the starting point of your own custom analysis.

  3.3.2 Finding Intra-chromosomal Interactions Genome-wide at High Resolution
   A common task is to find all the interactions in the genome.  With more sequencing and better data quality, the hope is to find interactions between individual 
    regulatory elements, at a resolution of 10kb or less (maybe 1kb or 500bp! depending on restriction enzyme used).  At these small resolutions it is near impossible 
    to identify significant inter-chromosomal interactions, and the search space for inter-chromosomal interactions is massive.  

   To speed up the process, HOMER will look at chromosomes individually which allows it to save on resources.  A separate program called findHiCInteractionsByChr.pl 
   automates this process and helps speed up the calculation.  Here's an example:
   %%%%%  findHiCInteractionsByChr.pl RenLab_HiC_cortex_merge_filtered -res 2000  -superRes 2000  -cpu 12 >RenLab_HiC_cortex_sigInter_intraChrom_2k2k.txt
   %%%%%  findHiCInteractionsByChr.pl RenLab_HiC_cortex_merge_filtered -res 2000  -superRes 10000 -cpu 12 >RenLab_HiC_cortex_sigInter_intraChrom_2k10k.txt
   %%%%%  findHiCInteractionsByChr.pl RenLab_HiC_cortex_merge_filtered -res 10000 -superRes 10000 -cpu 12 >RenLab_HiC_cortex_sigInter_intraChrom_10k10k.txt 

  ##The first argument MUST be the Hi-C tag directory.  The output interaction formatted file is sent to stdout, so make sure to capture the output in a file. 
    Other options are as follows:
 -res <#> : resolution of analysis, see above, default: 2000
 -superRes <#> : super resolution (window size), see above, default: 10000
 -minDist <#> : Minimum distance between regions to consider for an interaction (default: -superRes value)
 -maxDist <#> : Maximum distance between regions to consider for an interactions (default: 10,000,000) Changing this parameter may change the running time a bit
 -pvalue <#> : pvalue cutoff, default: 0.01
 -zscore <#> : modified z-score cutoff, default: 1.5
 -cpu <#> : number of CPUs to use, default: 1 (remember that more CPUs will require more memory too)
 -ped <background HiC directory> :  Will quantify background experiment reads at significant interactions.
 -std <#> : exclude regions with sequencing depth exceeding # std deviations, default: 4)
 -min <#> : exclude regions with sequencing depth less than this fraction of mean, default: 0.2)
